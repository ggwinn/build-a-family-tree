			<h3>ex-lover</h3>
			<p>
				Whether it is a letter, a screenshot, a Hinge (or other dating app) message, a text message, or a picture, include a screenshot of your ex-situationship or ex-lover who wasn’t your lover. Maybe until your reality becomes as blurry as this dynamic felt… After this dynamic, did you find a safer home for your nervous system, a safer relationship, or a safer way of being loved?

			<h3>location sharing</h3>
			<p>
				Whose location do you have? Who has your location? How many times have you asked for someone’s location? It can be so personal and even dangerous to know someone’s exact location at all times… When one of my friends asked me for my location, they asked by saying, “Do you want to be one of my sims?” So, let us see you acknowledge your little sims in your phone WITHOUT DOXXING THEM OF COURSE.. reflect on the intimacy of the act… from the “where are you” text when you’re still in the same building to the “did you make it home safe” texts. </p>

			<h3>experience with me</h3>
			<p>
				 Every time I went to drive, I would text my friends or give them updates to feel better if I was scared… they got to experience with me even though they weren’t in the car… would I have felt the confidence without their support and mini-check-ins… How much longer would it have taken me to explore the world beyond my house without their help? What do you text, call, or FaceTime your tribe, especially long-distance peeps, when you need some courage? Or so they can experience something with you? </p>

			<h3>characters that taught you important lessons</h3>
			<p>  Have you ever watched a television show or a movie and the characters make a good point that you kinda resonated with… maybe it’s not as cheesy and expected as you thought, or maybe it is, and you still related, either way, sometimes it can be good to hear it said by someone you parasocially recognize or relate to… maybe it it close to home. <p>

			<h3> quotes/visuals for grounding </h3>
			<p>  Affirm yourself… what quotes get you fired up, calm your nerves, or make you feel ready to take on the day? What words breathe life into you, reminding you that you are safe in your body, mind, and spirit? Or even—what meme pages give you an unexpected amount of joy and comfort, or validate your experiences? In the trenches of doom scrolling, I will say mindfulness memes are my favorite… There is something in the space between cheesiness, realness, and humor that makes it inspirational. The quotes from my close friend's story are just random wisdom I drop to keep myself stable lol… I post so much on my story and after spamposting, sometimes I need a mindfulness or awareness break… so take some if you’d like… You can still add your own if they resonate with you better.  </p>

			<h3> dollhouse instructions</h3>
			<p>

<p> When I was around 3 or 4 (yes, I have memories of that period), going to Build-A-Bear Workshop was always a treat. A cardboard box always accompanied this little treat. That cardboard box was special to me. I saw the peephole and punched out the door as the beginning of a home for my dolls, as I did not have a dollhouse at the time. I tried to plant the roots of my house multiple times, but each time, my mom would throw away the box. She just saw it as trash, something not to hold onto, something in the way of my toys or the living room. I saw a home . . . but this isn’t just about me; it’s about all of us. Where is home located?
</p>
<p>Directions: Enter each file, read the prompt, and collect screenshots as visual representations of home and your experiences with home physically, mentally, and emotionally within and outside of your body. Observe how you feel throughout the process, how the internet has shaped the location of home and the location of your healing... This might take some time... no need to rush... no limit... just home.
</p>
<p> You can use a random number generator online and set it to pick each number 1-9 or you can arrange the prompts however you would like. </p>
<p> When you're done... you can add choose if you want to add your portrait of healing to the build-a-familytree yard by emailing me </p>
