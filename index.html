			<h3>ex-lover</h3>
			<p>
				Whether it is a letter, a screenshot, a Hinge (or other dating app) message, a text message, or a picture, include a screenshot of your ex-situationship or ex-lover who wasn’t your lover. Maybe until your reality becomes as blurry as this dynamic felt… After this dynamic, did you find a safer home for your nervous system, a safer relationship, or a safer way of being loved?

			<h3>location sharing</h3>

				Whose location do you have? Who has your location? How many times have you asked for someone’s location? It can be so personal and even dangerous to know someone’s exact location at all times… When one of my friends asked me for my location, they asked by saying, “Do you want to be one of my sims?” So, let us see you acknowledge your little sims in your phone WITHOUT DOXXING THEM OF COURSE.. reflect on the intimacy of the act… from the “where are you” text when you’re still in the same building to the “did you make it home safe” texts. </p>

			<h3>location sharing</h3>
			<p>
				 Every time I went to drive, I would text my friends or give them updates to feel better if I was scared… they got to experience with me even though they weren’t in the car… would I have felt the confidence without their support and mini-check-ins… How much longer would it have taken me to explore the world beyond my house without their help? What do you text, call, or FaceTime your tribe, especially long-distance peeps, when you need some courage? Or so they can experience something with you? </p>
