        Whether it is a letter, a screenshot, a Hinge (or other dating app) message, a text message, or a picture, include a screenshot of your ex-situationship or ex-lover who wasn’t your lover. Maybe until your reality becomes as blurry as this dynamic felt… After this dynamic, did you find a safer home for your nervous system, a safer relationship, or a safer way of being loved?

        Whose location do you have? Who has your location? How many times have you asked for someone’s location? It can be so personal and even dangerous to know someone’s exact location at all times… When one of my friends asked me for my location, they asked by saying, “Do you want to be one of my sims?” So, let us see you acknowledge your little sims in your phone WITHOUT DOXXING THEM OF COURSE.. reflect on the intimacy of the act… from the “where are you” text when you’re still in the same building to the “did you make it home safe” texts.

        Every time I went to drive, I would text my friends or give them updates to feel better if I was scared… they got to experience with me even though they weren’t in the car… would I have felt the confidence without their support and mini-check-ins… How much longer would it have taken me to explore the world beyond my house without their help? What do you text, call, or FaceTime your tribe, especially long-distance peeps, when you need some courage? Or so they can experience something with you?

        When did the internet lowkey teach you a very valuable life skill or skills that could’ve helped you decorate and diy your home, recognize when you were unsafe around people, help you get your passport, or even change your mindset? Big or small.

       Some of our first friends… our stuffed animals. Who kept you safe when you were scared of the dark? Who brought you comfort when you felt alone as a child? (It could even be an old blanket or pillow tbh)

        Have you ever watched a television show or a movie and the characters make a good point that you kinda resonated with… maybe it’s not as cheesy and expected as you thought, or maybe it is, and you still related, either way, sometimes it can be good to hear it said by someone you parasocially recognize or relate to… maybe it it close to home.

       Whether it’s an old reliable or one of your favorite closet pieces, what are the things you always wear? Or what are some clothing pieces you have that carry memories? SHOW US! What is a hand-me-down you have, something that reminds you of the style of someone you love? Something that makes you feel like a character…

      <div class="body">
        Affirm yourself… what quotes get you fired up, calm your nerves, or make you feel ready to take on the day? What words breathe life into you, reminding you that you are safe in your body, mind, and spirit? Or even—what meme pages give you an unexpected amount of joy and comfort, or validate your experiences? In the trenches of doom scrolling, I will say mindfulness memes are my favorite… There is something in the space between cheesiness, realness, and humor that makes it inspirational. The quotes from my close friend's story are just random wisdom I drop to keep myself stable lol… I post so much on my story and after spamposting, sometimes I need a mindfulness or awareness break… so take some if you’d like… You can still add your own if they resonate with you better.
